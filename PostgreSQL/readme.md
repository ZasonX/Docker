# Docker making notes

1. try to write a dockerfile called 'Dockerfile'
    > it has to be run by VSCode in right click menu  
    > or to be run in the shell script
2. try to write a script to run 'docker build'
    > it cannot to be run in VSCode right click menu  
    > I have to call out a terminal to execute the commands by copy ans paste

All I did just built an docker image but not a docker container
I have to try something else...

## short summary

I have to ..
1. build an image
2. run the image as a container
so that, i can make docker itself to bring up my container as the docker.exe lives

...
why should i need the first step??
